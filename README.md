# Atmospheric Scattering

An implementation of atmospheric scattering. It will be based on the new HD rendering pipeline in Unity 2018, so it will probably will not be backwards compatible with earlier versions. In addition to implementing atmospheric scattering, I will also try to use newer features and tools in Unity I haven't used yet (like the Shader Graph, Compute Shaders, Scriptable Rendering Pipeline).

The sources used in this project are also mentioned in the wiki.
